# LSB-Image-Steganography
**LSB Image Steganography** is a C-based project that implements Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding and decoding techniques to hide secret information inside image files. The project allows you to encode a secret message or file inside an image and later decode it back without noticeable changes to the image.
