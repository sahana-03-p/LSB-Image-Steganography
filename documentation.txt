5.Description     : The art and science of hiding information by embedding messages within other, 
                    seemingly harmless messages. Bits of unused data are replaced by bits of valuable 
                    information using LSB mechanism. Sender and receiver will have individual key / secret 
                    based on which they will be able to extract the actual data from the image. 
                    This project also gives basic level understanding of image processing methodologies.

6.Sample input and outputs:

   Key Features:
   - Encodes text files into 24-bit BMP images
   - Decodes hidden messages from stego images
   - Supports multiple file formats (.txt, .c, .sh, .h)
   - Verifies image capacity before encoding
   - Uses magic string "#*" for stego image identification
   - Maintains original image dimensions and quality

   Technical Implementation:
   - Each secret byte (8 bits) is distributed across 8 image bytes (1 bit per byte)
   - BMP header (54 bytes) is preserved unchanged
   - Encodes file metadata (extension, size) along with content

   ENCODING PROCESS:

   Input:
   - Source Image: beautiful.bmp (1024×768)
   - Secret File: secret.txt containing "My password is SECRET ;)"
   - Command: ./a.out -e beautiful.bmp secret.txt default.bmp

   Output:
   - Stego Image: default.bmp (visually identical to original)
   - Console Output:
        Opening Files Done...
        Secret file size: 26 bytes
        Secret file extension: .txt
        width = 1024
        height = 768
        Checking the capacity done...
        Header Copied Successfully...
        Encoded Magic string Successfully...
        Encoded secret File extention Size Successfully...
        Encoded secret File extention Successfully...
        Encoded secret File Size Successfully...
        Encoded secret File data Successfully...
        ENCODING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

   DECODING PROCESS:

   Input:
   - Stego Image: default.bmp
   - Command: ./a.out -d default.bmp

   Output:
   - Secret File: output.txt
   - Console Output:
        Stego image file opened successfully
        BMP header skipped
        Magic string verified
        Secret file extension size decoded: 4
        --output.txt
        Secret file extension decoded: .txt
        Secret file size decoded: 24
        Secret file data decoded successfully
        DECODING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

   FILE COMPARISON:

   Original vs Stego Image:
   - File sizes: Both 2,359,351 bytes (identical)
   - Visual appearance: No visible difference
   - Pixel analysis: Only LSBs modified 
   
   Original vs Decoded Secret:
   - secret.txt: "My password is SECRET ;)" (24 bytes)
   - output.txt: "My password is SECRET ;)" (24 bytes)
   - Content: Exactly identical

7. Error Handling Examples:
   - Insufficient capacity: "Error: Image does not have sufficient capacity"
   - Invalid BMP / stego: "Error: Invalid argument for encoding\n"
                          "Error: Invalid argument for decoding\n"
   - File not found: "ERROR: Unable to open file"
